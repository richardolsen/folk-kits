# This doesn't work. Need to find out how to upload in folk.

Wish the web server handles route {/post/media/(.*)$} with handler {

    set data "here"
    set fsize [string bytelength $data]

    dict create statusAndHeaders "HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: $fsize\n\n" \
    body $data
}
