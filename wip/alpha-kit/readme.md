Alpha Kit is an attempt to make a folk kit system.
All other kits will depend on it.
It needs to be added to the built-in programs and it will self install.

Once alpha kit is installed other kits can be installed remotely.

 Copy all files into a sub-directory in your user-programs folder for your folk system.
 eg.  My folk system is called folk-ssps
   1.  If there isn't already a folder for your systerm eg folk/user-program folk-ssps then create it.
   2.  Copy the alpha kit directory into your systems folder. eg folk/user-programs/folk-ssps/alpha-kit
   3.  Move the alpha-kit-installer.folk file into folk/user-programs/
   4.  Restart the folk system to install the files.
   5.  The alpha-kit-installer.folk file will stay in your top folder in order
       for the alpha-kit and other kits to automatically run. 
       
If you prefer to run the kits via the apriltags then delete the  alpha-kit-installer.folk file after reading it to determine the tag id which the alpha kit it running.

Please note this is a work in progress and nothing works yet!
