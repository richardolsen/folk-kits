This is a kit for making printed pages with various layouts.  

Just a place to record ideas currently.

Something like...

Claim the title page is an A4 template with 15 columns and 24 rows
Claim the title page has a header at 1,1 and is 15 columns wide and 2 rows high

Wish the title page stores its template data in the "title-template.json" file

Wish $this is a printed page using the A4 title template
Wish $this has a header with the text "Print Kit"
